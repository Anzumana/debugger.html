Before you do anything else try to remove the project again from your computer and clone it again

```bash
rm -rf [yourpath]/debugger.html
git clone https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html
cd debugger.html
yarn install
yarn start
```

Don't forget to ask in our [slack room][slack] or fill an [issue][yarn-issue] if you get stuck.
We are always happy to help.
